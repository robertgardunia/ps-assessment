Noted data Issues:
I had to go in and correct the JSON as it was missing commas. There is also an invalid date on Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain "2023-14-29" which I didn't correct as there was no way to know the intended date. A nice feature, on the entry side, would be a date validator sto avoid putting garbage in the database. For the sake of simplicity I also standardized all the image formats to webp rather than mess with getting content-type.
